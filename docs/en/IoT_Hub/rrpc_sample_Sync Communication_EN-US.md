# Sync Communication
This document describes the sync communication feature based on the **rrpc_sample** of the SDK.

## 1. Creating Device in Console

#### 1. Background
Because of the async communication mode of the MQTT protocol based on the publish/subscribe pattern, the server cannot control the device to synchronously return the result. To solve this problem, IoT Hub implements a sync communication mechanism called Revert RPC (RRPC).
That is, the server initiates a request to the client, and the client responds immediately and replies synchronously.
* Subscription message topic: `$rrpc/rxd/{productID}/{deviceName}/+`
* Request message topic: `$rrpc/rxd/{productID}/{deviceName}/{processID}`
* Response message topic: `$rrpc/txd/{productID}/{deviceName}/{processID}`
* processID: unique message ID generated by the server to identify different RRPC messages. The corresponding RRPC request message can be found through the `processID` carried in the RRPC response message.

#### 2. Schematic

* **RRPC requests time out in 4s**, that is, if the device doesn't respond within 4s, the request will be considered to have timed out.

#### 3. Product and device creation
Create an air conditioner product and an `airConditioner1` device as instructed in [Device Interconnection](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/634/11913).

## 2. Compiling and Running Demo (with **Key-Authenticated Device** as Example)

#### 1. Compile the SDK
Modify `CMakeLists.txt` to ensure that the following options exist:
```
set(BUILD_TYPE                   "release")
set(COMPILE_TOOLS                "gcc") 
set(PLATFORM 	                 "linux")
set(FEATURE_MQTT_COMM_ENABLED ON)
set(FEATURE_RRPC_ENABLED ON)
set(FEATURE_AUTH_MODE "KEY")
set(FEATURE_AUTH_WITH_NOTLS OFF)
set(FEATURE_DEBUG_DEV_INFO_USED  OFF)
```
Run the following script for compilation.
```
./cmake_build.sh 
```
The demo output `rrpc_sample` is in the `output/release/bin` folder.

#### 2. Enter the device information
Enter the information of the `airConditioner1` device created above in the JSON file `aircond_device_info1.json`:
```
{
    "auth_mode":"KEY",	
    "productId":"KL4J2K3JZ8",
    "deviceName":"airConditioner1",	
    "key_deviceinfo":{    
        "deviceSecret":"zOZXUaycuwlePtTcD78dBA=="
    }
}
```

#### 3. Run the `rrpc_sample` demo
You can see that the `airConditioner1` device has subscribed to the RRPC message and then entered the waiting status.
```
./rrpc_sample -c ./aircond_device_info1.json -l 1000

```

#### 4. Call TencentCloud API `PublishRRPCMessage` to send an RRPC request message
Go to [API Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=iotcloud&Version=2018-06-14&Action=PublishRRPCMessage&SignVersion=), enter the personal key and device parameter information, select **Online Call**, and send the request.

#### 5. Observe the RRPC request message
Observe the printout of the `airConditioner1` device, and you can see that the RRPC request message has been received, and the `processID` is `469`.
```
DBG|2020-08-04 00:07:36|rrpc_client.c|_rrpc_message_cb(85): topic=$rrpc/rxd/KL4J2K3JZ8/airConditioner1/469

INF|2020-08-04 00:07:36|rrpc_sample.c|_rrpc_message_handler(137): rrpc message=closed
```

#### 6. Observe the RRPC response message
Observe the printout of the `airConditioner1` device, and you can see that the RRPC request message has been processed, the RRPC response message has been replied, and the `processID` is `469`.
```
DBG|2020-08-04 00:07:36|mqtt_client_publish.c|qcloud_iot_mqtt_publish(340): publish packetID=0|topicName=$rrpc/txd/KL4J2K3JZ8/airConditioner1/469|payload=ok
```

#### 7. Observe the server response result
Observe the response result of the server, and you can see that the RRPC response message has been received. `MessageId` is `469`, and `Payload` is `b2s=` after being `Base64-encoded`, which is the same as the actual response message of the client after being `Base64-encoded`. At this point, it can be confirmed that the response message has been received.
