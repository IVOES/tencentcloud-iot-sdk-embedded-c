# IoT Hub C-SDK
IoT Hub C-SDK relies on a secure and powerful data channel to enable IoT developers to connect devices to the cloud for two-way communication.
The following are the corresponding documents of the features of the SDK.

## Getting Started
The **mqtt_sample_Getting Started.md** document describes how to create devices in the IoT Hub console and quickly try out device connection to IoT Hub over the MQTT protocol for message receiving/sending based on the **mqtt_sample** of the SDK.

## Device Shadow
The **shadow_sample_Device Shadow.md** document describes the device shadow feature and demonstrates the data flow and feature of the shadow based on the **shadow_sample** of the SDK.

## Firmware Update
The **ota_sample_Firmware Update.md** document describes the firmware update feature and demonstrates the firmware update process and feature based on the **ota_mqtt_sample** of the SDK.

## Gateway Feature 
The **gateway_sample_Gateway Feature.md** document describes how to apply for a gateway device and bind a subdevice in the IoT Hub console and quickly connect the gateway device to IoT Hub over the MQTT protocol for proxied subdevice connection/disconnection and message receiving/sending based on the **gateway_sample** of the SDK.

## Device Interconnection
The **door_aircond_sample_Device Interconnection.md** document describes how to quickly try out device interconnection based on the **aircond_shadow_sample** and **door_mqtt_sample** of the SDK by using the message forwarding and rule engine features of IoT Hub in a smart home scenario.

## Dynamic Registration
The **dynreg_dev_sample_Dynamic Registration.md** document describes the device connection authentication and dynamic registration features of IoT Hub.

## Broadcast Communication
The **broadcast_sample_Broadcast Communication.md** document describes the broadcast communication feature of IoT Hub.

## Sync Communication
The **rrpc_sample_Sync Communication.md** document describes the sync communication feature of IoT Hub.

## Device Log Reporting
The **log_upload_Device Log Reporting.md** document describes the device log reporting feature and its usage.

## CoAP Communication
The **coap_sample.md** document describes the CoAP communication feature of IoT Hub.
